# Computer Architecture Final - NES Audio Processing Unit
This website is a description of Nathaniel Tan and Noah Rivkin's Computer Architecture final project.

The goal of this project was to replicate the audio processing unit(APU) found in the Nintendo Entertainment System using verilog. Although the initial goal of the project was to be able to process original NES music file on our APU to be played, we had to scale back due to time constraints. Our APU implements two pulse channels, a triangle channel, and a noise channel. While all of our channels work, the NES converts music files to channel inputs within the CPU, which we did not replicate.
